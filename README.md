Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Define Software Engineering:
- Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. 

2. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

  Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):- Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It differs from traditional programming in its structured approach, focus on quality, integration of multiple disciplines, use of formal methods, and emphasis on testing and verification. Software Development life cycle model is a process model used to design, develop, test, and maintain the software application.

3. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
- a) Planning - involves gathering business requirements and defining the project scope, objectives, & timeliness.
b) Design - The software design is elaborated into a detailed software software design document (SDD). 
c) Software development - This phase involves the actual development of the software.
d)  Testing - Before deploying the software, it is tested for functionality, performance, security, usability, and acceptance.
e) Deployment - In this phase, the final product is delivered to the intended users. 
f) Maintenance - This involves ongoing maintenance and updates to the software to ensure it continues to meet user needs. 
g) Operations - This includes updates and bug fixes.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile and Waterfall are two different approaches to managing software development projects. Agile is more flexible and adaptable, emphasizing customer collaboration and continuous testing and feedback. Waterfall is more predictable and traditional, assuming fixed requirements and sequential phases.

4. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
- Iterative and Incremental Approach: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of small, functional project segments.
Continuous Feedback and Adaptation: Agile involves continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development process, allowing for changes in project requirements and priorities as needed.
KEY DIFFERENCE
Approach to Project Management: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, while Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach.
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is more adaptable to changing requirements and can handle unexpected changes during the development process, while Waterfall is less adaptable and assumes that project requirements are fixed and well-defined.
Agile applies in projects with changing requirements or uncertain timelines.
Waterfall applies in projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed timeline.


4. Requirements Engineering: What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of a software system.
PROCESS OF REQUIREMEMNTS ENGINEERING

5. Software Design Principles: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down complex software systems into smaller, independent modules or components that are tightly coupled together.
Benefits of Modularity: Improved maintainability, enhanced scalability, code reusability, improved collaboration, and easier testing.
Challenges in Implementing Modularity: Understanding complexity, overcoming hurdles.
Real World Applications: Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Microservices. 

6. Testing in Software Engineering: Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
LEVELS OF SOFTWARE TESTING 
a) Unit Testing - Involves small, individual units of software to catch bugs early in the development process. 
b) Integration Testing - Checks data flow between modules adn identities defects that may rise during integration. 
c) System Testing - Involves testing performance, load, readability, and security, to ensure the system is robust. 
d) Acceptance Testing - Final level of testing that invloves, testing the software in the users environment to ensure it works asexpected. 
IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE TESTING 
a) Early Detection of defects - identification of bugs early
b) Improved Quality - testing ensures that software meets standard requirements 
c) Reduced Risks - testing reduces risk of software failure
d) Enhanced User Experience - teating software is user friendly 
e) Increased confidence - testing gives confidence in the software that has been deployed. 


7. Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on a software project. 
IMPORTANCE OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
Collaboration: VCS enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: They record detailed histories of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.
Branching and Merging: They support creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: They allow reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.
Popular Version Control Systems:
Git: A distributed VCS known for its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching and merging capabilities.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS that provides a simple and straightforward interface for managing changes to files and directories.
Mercurial: Another distributed VCS similar to Git, offering a user-friendly interface and strong support for branching and merging.
CVS (Concurrent Versions System): One of the earliest VCS, CVS is a centralized system that provides basic version control features.
Perforce: A commercial VCS known for its scalability and support for large binary files, often used in game development and other industries with large assets. 
FEATURES OF VCS
Repository: A central location where all changes are stored.
Working Copy: A local copy of the codebase where changes are made.
Commit: A process where changes are saved to the repository.
Push: A process where changes are sent to the central repository.
Pull: A process where changes are retrieved from the central repository.
Branching: Creating a separate copy of the codebase for new features or experiments.
Merging: Combining changes from different branches into the main codebase.
Conflict Resolution: Resolving conflicts when merging branches.
Error Recovery: Reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.

8. Software Project Management: Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? A software project manager is responsible for leading a team of software developers and oversee the entire software development life cycle, from planning to execution and closure. 
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF A SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGER 
a) Planning and Execution:
